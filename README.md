As Azure blockchain is a kind of open ledger. If we add this blockchain to EVM machines then each vote will be open to all the voters of country along with the political leaders. If we take an example to suppose that A & B are two candidates in the election then on the day of voting, let the first voter vote for A. Then it will be appear in blockchain ledger as name of candidate as “A” with timestamp precise to a milli-second. After that if second voter again voted for A then it will again appear as “A” with timestamp and if third one voted for “B” then it will appear as “B” with its time and the process continues. This will make the whole database appear to each of the voter as well as to the candidates of the parties. This will make the whole voting very much transparent. In this if any of the hacker wants to change any of the vote then it is not possible as it leads to change in hash of the block and it will also notify all of the other nodes i.e. people active on the ledger. This will lead to make all the claims of EVM hacking invalid. And if we want to count the votes at the end of the polls, then this will be easily counted with the use of some Database function.
